/*
 This mglRenderer2 processes commands and handles details of setting up Metal rendering passes for each frame.
 This takes unprocessed commands from our mglCommandInterface, but doesn't know about how the commands were created.
 This processes each command in a few steps, but doesn't worry about the details of each command:
  - doNondrawingWork() is a chance for each command to modify the state of this app and/or gather data about the system.
  - draw() is a chance for each command to draw itself as part of a rendering pass / frame.
  - filling in success status and timing data around each command
 This reports completed commands back to our mglCommandInterface, but doesn't know what happens from there.
