// Protocol for communication classes with matlab.
// This defines a set of methods that can be used
// to open/close and read/write to matlab.
//
// It is declared as a protocol so that future
// versions of the code need simply conform to this
// protocol and can replace the underlying
// communication strucutre.  The key task to
// implement is to read and write bytes to and from
// a stream, like a socket.
//
// Utilities in mglCommandBytes.h can work on top
// of the byte-level comminication to safely read
// and write supported data types and arrays.  The
// callback types mglReader and mglWriter make this
// integration possible.  This app and matlab
// should share the same header, mglCommandBytes.h,
// and this should make for smooth interoperation!
