/*
 mglCommand factors out a pattern common to all mgl Metal commands, including drawing and non-drawing commands.
 This explicit model gives us something that we can:
    - test
    - extend
    - document
    - queue up in batches
    - gather timing around
    - potentially load as dynamic plugins

 This also gives us a way to oragnize our code better.
 The state and details of each command can live in mglCommand objects.
 Other cross-cutting details of communication, flow control, timing, and and Metal rendering
 can live elsewhere in mglCommandInterface, mglRenderer, etc.

 A change: upfront reading from the command interface or direct init(), stashing valuesin fields, separated from doing work.
 A change: stash query results first, write query results to command interface later.

    // Commands should have no-arg init methods that we can use for testing.

    // How many frames left to draw for this command instance?
    // Most drawing commands would start with with framesRemaining == 1, meaning draw once and move on.
    // Drawing commands that start with framesRemaining > 1 support repeated drawing across a number of frames.
    // All commands should decrement framesRemaining each frame, with 0 indicating that drawing is done.
    // Non-drawing commands would start with framesRemaining <= 0.
