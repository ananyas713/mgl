/*
 mglCommand factors out a pattern common to all mgl Metal commands, including drawing and non-drawing commands.
 This explicit model gives us something that we can:
 - test
 - extend
 - document
 - queue up in batches
 - gather timing around
 - potentially load as dynamic plugins

 This also gives us a way to oragnize our code better.
 The state and details of each command can live in mglCommand objects.
 Other cross-cutting details of communication, flow control, timing, and and Metal rendering
 can live elsewhere in mglCommandInterface, mglRenderer, etc.

    // Here is where mglCommandInterface and mglRenderer can record and report what happened to this command.
    var results = mglCommandResults()

    // How many frames left to draw for this command instance?
    // Most drawing commands would start with with framesRemaining == 1, meaning draw once and move on.
    // Drawing commands that start with framesRemaining > 1 support repeated drawing across a number of frames.
    // All commands should decrement framesRemaining each frame, with 0 indicating that drawing is done.
    // Non-drawing commands would start with framesRemaining <= 0.

    //  - directly in memory, for use during tests
    //  - by reading from an mglCommandInterface and/or writing to an MTLDevice, for use with a connected client, allowed to fail and return nil
    // Both inits can call up to this as "super.init()"
